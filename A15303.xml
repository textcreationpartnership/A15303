            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo thankfull I am, as tis poſſible for me, ſo farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath your worth in termes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall. I here preſent you with the firſt fruits of my Autumne-vintage, with the beſt grape, that ever was preſſed into wine. The vine, wheron it grows, is the true vine: and the cup of ſaluation is the benefit, which it
<pb facs="tcp:21372:3"/> brings to the worthy receauer. This makes glad the heart of man, it cheares vp the drooping ſoule, recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats the ſpirits, quickeneth the ſenſes, and raiſeth vp the whole man to the higheſt pitch of happines. And now giue me leaue, plainely to commend vnto you the ſubiect it ſelfe, or rather the Lord, and Maſter of my enſuing labours, which is this vine, this grape, and this wine, ſoprecious, ſo excellent, ſo everlaſtingly ſauing. Tis Ieſus the Author of ſaluation, that's his name aboue all names: at the mention whereof S. Bernard in his 15. ſermon on the Canticles was rapt into admiration, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Hierome, and other of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ancient Chriſtians of the Primitiue Church into amazement, and adoration. And well they might, for there is none other meanes vnder heauen to attaine to ſalvation: this ſaues from the ſtrength of death, from the pit of hell, from the tyranny of the Devill. But being diſhonoured by a diſgracefull pen, I am not aſham'd to confeſſe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the <hi>Lord</hi> in the deſpight of his enemies, with heart, and knee, and pen: and am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bold to commend this Apologetique, or ſchole-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of mine to your courteous acceptance, in token of my oblig'd thankfullnes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> 
               <hi>Confuſed Ropſody of vaine, Idle conceipts:</hi> this is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Appendix Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, wherewith he hath rewarded me, for writing the <hi>Shiſmatical Puritan.</hi> I aimde at the conformity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Brethren, that Gods name might bee glorified by our Church through the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of Chriſtian vnity. I aſſure M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prinne,</hi> If he bee the Author: that Cauſidicants, ſhould be better Subiects to God, and to his Immediate Vicegere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in theſe Churches, the King, than to be Prime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Breaking the peace of Orthodoxe Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But 'tis now, as our B. Lord and Sauiour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, <hi>There muſt be offences. Math.</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>but woe vnto the man, by whom they Come.

Cor. 11, 19. <hi>There ſhalbe falſe Teachers, which ſhall priuily bring in damnable Hereſies, denying the Lord, that bought them.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 1. There muſt be offences, hereſies, falſe Teachers. There muſt be, and are falſe Teachers. But yet here is one comfort in ſo great a miſery: The Falſe Teachers are not more learned, than M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ignoramus, a young ſcholler, a ſtranger to Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall Diuinitie.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:21372:4"/>
            <p> For his bold Cenſure of my <hi>Schiſmatical Puritan,</hi> I ſhall quickly prooue, that therein he proou'd himſelfe to be very vnlearned. Or els without the helpe of a Conventicle he might haue giuen a better Cenſure. For the Preface, the Identity of a Puritan, that is not <hi>confuſ'd:</hi> but an infallible, and a perſpicuous knowledge concerning the Schiſmatique ſo that a man may but read, and know, what kind of Puritan I vnderſtand. For the Equivocates; the good, and euill Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, being diſtinguiſhed, The Equiuocant, the Puritan, hath loſt his amazing ambiguity; and then there is noe</p>
            <q>Pulchrum digito monstrari, &amp; dicier Hic eſt.</q>
            <p>Noe man will admire him for an holy, godly, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Profeſſor. The boyes in the ſtreete may poynt with their finger, which is the Honeſt, and which is the diſſembling Puritan. Secondly, my definition of a <hi>fallacious Puritan</hi> is not confuſ'd, but ſo perfect, ſo diſtinct, ſo true, ſo intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as an Eſſentiall definition ought to be. There is the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Quid,</hi> What a Puritan is? A Proteſtant. There is the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis differentia Qualis,</hi> what manner a Proteſtant, a Puritan is? A Non-conformiſt. Thirdly <hi>the ten kinds of Puritans:</hi> this diuiſion is eſſentiall: For there are ten ſeuerall Puritanieties, by which one kind of Puritan diſtinctly differs from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you may read in my Preface. And my Sermon is not confuſ'd: 1. The Command: 2. The things Commanded: 3. The obſeruing of the things Commanded: 4. The manner How, are without ambiguity, according to the rules of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and confirmation. Thus my booke is not confuſ'd And <hi>vaine, and Idle it is not,</hi> For the end thereof is neceſſary: <hi>viz:</hi> The Reformation of non-Conformiſts to the glory of God, and Preſervation of his Church. This I intended though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prinne</hi> doth ſhut his eies, and will not ſee a truth manifeſtly viſible. And a <hi>Rapſodie</hi> tis none, no ſong: no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of a ſong: no ſinging of a ſong. And I would to God, that there were noe canting tunes among the Factious. The truth is, that the <hi>Eſſentialls Eſſentiats</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>their modali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> haue confoumded the fanatique Profeſſor, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21372:4"/> his Chaire: and therefore he complaines of that confuſion; yet being vnwilling to forſake a Bafling Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to the Eie of the world He brags, that my <hi>Schiſmatical Puritan is vaine, and idle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes that the Profeſſor will neuer reforme: or els why is a book written againſt <hi>Bowing at the name of Ieſus: an Appendix,</hi> a leane too, a ſimilitude of the Howſe buylt vpon the ſands: Confuſ'd, vaine, and Idle ſtuffe. Ile aſſure you, that this is very Confuſ'd. For whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Prinne ſhould firſt haue diſtinguiſh'd the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten infallible knowledge in the Reader: He contrarily ſtriues to teach, that the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is ſo ambiguos that ſometimes tis not vnderſtood. It is ſtrange that a Pretender to learning ſhould rather teach ſtumbling at a word, to cauſe confuſion then encourage ſeekers after actuall knowledg to diue into the profound inſtructions of the wiſe: or elſe the diſtinction of the Right reverend, and learned Bp. <hi>Andrewes</hi> concerning the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> might haue ſatisfied any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall capacity.</p>
            <p>Secondly M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prinne</hi> is not confuſ'd only at handling the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> but in his <hi>materia Circa quam:</hi> in the ſubſtance of his booke. For he hath no explication of dutie towards <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which he ought to haue had, if he will proue, <hi>ad par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is no duty of the text, and he hath no explication of the ſeverall kinds of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> which he ought to haue had for his private friends ſake, that they might vnderſtand, how that no ceremony is a duty of the text. Certainely a neceſſary an vniuerſall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a duty of the text; as a thing conſidered, bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is both a dutie, and Ceremony; <hi>ſed formaliter,</hi> for ſeuerall reſpects: as it tis a ceremony, tis not a duty; as tis a dutie tis non ceremony, as you ſhall learne hereafter.</p>
            <p>He is not only confuſ'd in handling the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>Appendix,</hi> but alſo in his Method. Let an vnderſtanding man obſerue his manner of diſpute, and hee cannot but affirme that he is altogether vnworthy to teach,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21372:5"/> or to contradict the Learned, and Conforming Profeſſors of of our Church. His method is neither eſſentiall, nor demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue, and then it's not neceſſary. Ti's fit that it be knowne, what it is. It is a <hi>Delemma,</hi> whoſe two generall parts are groſſe miſtaks. Firſt he chargeth <hi>Biſhop Andrewes, Mr</hi>. <hi>Adams,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> and <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> that they teach, that bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is nothing els but a duty of the text The oppoſition of the 2 parts doth warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me, thus to write. Then He ſaith that <hi>Zanchius Mr</hi> 
               <hi>Hooker, Dr</hi>. <hi>Boyes,</hi> and <hi>Mr</hi>. <hi>Widdowes,</hi> defend this aſſertion, that bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is but an indifferent, innocent, harmeles Ceremony: yet all theſe <hi>Biſhop Andrewes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zanchius</hi> &amp;c. doe teach, that bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is both a duty and Ceremony, which, how this can be, he is not able to vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>He is ſo ignorant that he cannot tell whether all things haue their perculiar times. Hence it is, that he confounds the time of divine ſeruice with the time of ſwearing, and blaſpheming with any ſinfull time, when <hi>Ieſus</hi> is named. He hath not learned the difference betweene a categoricall, and an excluſiue ſenſe, and therefoer he is not a ſham'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre; becauſe the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Baſil</hi> enjoyned Canonicall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to bowe at the name of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> therefore only they did bowe at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> He is ſo wilfull in his opinion, that he denies (in the deſpight of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that either Primitiue Church; or any Reformed Church ought to bowe at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He perceiues not: that in or at the time, when <hi>Ieſus</hi> is named every knee ſhall <hi>bow,</hi> are promiſeuoſly read. So it ſeemes that he is not a Grammarian. Notwithſtanding all this ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he ſo earneſtly diſputs, as if he would talke him ſelfe out of breath, or elſe what meanes his zealous Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie? The argument of Souereignty is diſputed ſix times at handling the meaneing of the text. The argument of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> before another is repeated 8 times ſix times in the third queſtion twiſe in the fourth. The Arg of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21372:5"/> bowing only to the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> and not to the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted ſix times. The argument of preferring one perſon of the deity before the other is twiſe diſputed. The argument that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name only of Incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. is diſputed 5 times. That <hi>Ieſus</hi> is not <hi>Ieſus</hi> to the Deuils &amp;c. is diſputed at rhe ſecond and third Queſtion. That bowing is only Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call is diſputed foure times. That <hi>Lord</hi> is the name aboue every name diſputed thriſe.</p>
            <p>The metaphoricall ſence of bowing he hath ſeparated from the letter of of the text, and makes that to be the only manner of bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus. Philip.</hi> 2. 10. But he muſt Vnderſtand, that there is a reall bowing, and more morall, then to be only metaphoricall, as it appeares at the end of his arguments anſwear'd concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the text: where he hath confounded an excluſiue, with a compar'd ſence. Thus: bowing at the laſt day &amp;c. is the only principall, and therefore t' is the only bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> hence he hath falſified 15. ſcriptures. many primitiue fathers &amp; others: the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of them is but foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore <hi>Iſtos modos dice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di: Per ſe: &amp; per accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> thoſe naturall, &amp; accidentall manner of ſpeeches he confounds. Thus: <hi>ſome doe abuſe Bowing at the name of Ieſus,</hi> as papiſts, &amp; Ignorant Proteſtants: Therefore tis no harmeles ceremony. And he is ſo decent, ſo trimme in his arguments co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of bowing, that he confounds, Coordination, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination with contrarie oppoſition. Thus: <hi>Bowing with the heart, and bowing with the knee</hi> (which are ſubordinate) <hi>doe differ, therefore they are ſo contrary, as two contrary maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To read, &amp; bow; to heare, and bow &amp;c,</hi> are Coordinate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet theſe with him are ſo contrarie, as that they <hi>cannot be done together without confuſion.</hi> Now behold the ſtrang learning of a monſtrous learned Immethodiſt. Is he not rare for diſpurations being ſo ignorant of modalities? Is he not excellent to teach our Chutch being ſo braue a Babe in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding?</p>
            <p>Againe his Appendix is vaine, and Idle. For in what the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21372:6"/> holy Ghoſt doth ſeriouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that he neglects to remember. <hi>The Holy Ghoſts</hi> reaſon, why all knees ſhall bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is: becauſe <hi>Ieſus tooke on him our nature, and then did ſo humbly demeane himſelfe, that he died the death of the Croſſe to ſaue his Enemies Ro.</hi> 5. 8. For this cauſe God honored <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſo much, that he commands every knee to bow at his name. This is the ſcope of the text: and then is not <hi>Mr</hi>. <hi>Prinne,</hi> vaine, and idle in his conceipt, to ſuppoſe argumenrs, to contradict the good &amp; iuſt meaning of the Holy Ghoſt: who is that True teacher, that God is the Iuſt rewarder of <hi>Ieſus</hi> his the greateſt Humility? Is it not vaine, and an idle conceipt, for to thinke better of <hi>Mr</hi>, <hi>Prinns</hi> arguments, to cauſe no Bowing at <hi>Ieſus</hi> his name. then of the Holy Ghoſts dictate, which is <hi>Ieſus</hi> his merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be, and Gods Exaltation of <hi>Ieſus</hi> the cauſes, why every knee ſhall bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> It is vaine and idle to fight againſt God: this is the opinion of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of the law <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. yet ſo vaine: and ſo idle, the younger Lawier is, that he would rather that his arguments ſhould be beliued then the moſt credible truth of the Holy Ghoſt. Here is a ſtrange oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may and ought verily to beleiue, that a man ſhould not dare thus to diſpute againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>What may be thought to be the cauſe that a man ſhould grow ſo bold as to queſtion the Holy Ghoſt for his doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine? Certainely the <hi>myſtery of iniquitie</hi> is working a new worke. Thus. If this name <hi>(Ieſus)</hi> were diſreſpected, not ſo publiquely magnified as tis by the outward mans Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, or at the time of divine ſervice; then doubtles the Pure, Holy doctrine, and diſcipline of Elect <hi>Geneua</hi> ſhall be taught every where, to reforme this Church of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine.</hi> Doe but diſhonour the head of the Church, and then regenerate Geneuaters ſhall gouerne the church, the King, the Realmes, nay <hi>Ieſus</hi> himſelfe. If obiection be made, that the moſt Reuerend <hi>Arch Biſhop Cranmer, the Right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop Ridley, Father Latimer,</hi> and other learned and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21372:6"/> Holy Martyrs were burned into aſhes, for their conſtant profeſſion of the doctrine and diſcipline of this reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church. Anſweare muſt be made, that the Holy Mother <hi>Geneua,</hi> hath better doctrine, and diſcipline, then <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> ever knew. The doctrine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of faithfull <hi>Geneua,</hi> are all ſubſtance: they are all gold. Oh if that Religion were here adminiſtred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery presbyter ſhall be greater than a Monarch, and euery Iuſtice of peace aboue the Presbyter. And were not this an Excellent Reformation; when the Children of the Church, her Subordinate Members ſhalbe made ſuch Tranſcendent Princes? A daring phantaſtique ſuperſtition! The Honour of <hi>Ieſus</hi> exalted farre aboue all Heauens muſt be nullified, to make Schiſmaticall Puritans, Kings. Imperious Holines!</p>
            <p>See a ſtrange wonder: here is Lucifer-like pride in deede. The Deuills were caſt out of Heauen <hi>Eſay.</hi> 14. 14. for their pride, becauſe they would not belieue in the Sonne of God, the Confirming Mediator of Angells: ſo the Schoolemen. And ſhall ſly Profeſſors then, be ſpared, ſeeing they will not Bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which is a ſigne, that they doe not belieue in the Redeeming Sauiour?</p>
            <p>If a Lawie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhall induſtriouſly write againſt the law, is it credible, that He is a Religious Obſeruer, or a lawfull Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the law? Where is the good Conſcience, the Neceſſary Subiect of the higher Powers mentioned at <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5? This ſtands at the Barre, and alleageth Gods Heauenly law: <hi>All knees ſhall bow at the name of Ieſus:</hi> and tis baffled with an Outery. <hi>A Reformation. A Reformation. To bow at the name of Ieſus is Superſtition. To bow at the name of Ieſus is Superſtition.</hi> The good Conſcience deſireth a pacificall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but the violence of aſpiring Spirites, will not endure to feare the truth: therefore I deſire the Chriſtian Reader to obſerue the plea of a good conſcience. Thus: The tie of Gods law, and of the Kings lawes deriu'd from Gods, is Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to binde all good Subiects vnto Obedience. Firſt the text binds all Chriſtians in faith to belieue, and in manners
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21372:7"/> to Bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus:</hi> which I haue proou'd at handling this Queſtion. <hi>Whether Bowing at the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, be a duty of the text?</hi> To ſecond the text, our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lord, the King, hath foure lawes, to humble his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in faith, and manners; to Bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> article of our Reformed faith, which <hi>is the Authority of the Church, to ordaine Rites, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> whereof Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is one, though it be commanded by God originally, yet in application to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Non-conformiſts, tis the Churches Canon. Then by the Doctrine of our Reformed faith, Tis plaine, that we muſt bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Becauſe our Church-Authority hath decreed this Bowing (as you ſee) according to ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The ſecond is the 34 Article, which is the Traditions of the Church, and bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal is more neceſſary then thoſe being particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd thus; <hi>Whoſoeuer through his priuate Iudgment, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and purpoſely doth openly breake the traditions of the Church &amp;c. ought to be rebuked openly (that others may feare, to doe the like) as he, that offendeth againſt the Common order of the Church, and woundeth the Conſcience of the weake Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Then tis plaine by the teſtimony of Orthodoxe faith, that all muſt bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus Sub paenâ publicae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargutionis</hi> vnder paine of open Rebuke. The third law is the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of our Church. The words are theſe. <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall here-after affirme, that the Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church of England by law Eſtabliſhed, are wicked, Anti-Christian, or ſuperſtitious, or ſuch, as being Commanded by lawfull Authority, men who are Zealouſly, and godlily affected, may not with any good conſcience approue them, vſe them, or as occaſion requireth, ſubſcribe vnto them, let him be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ipſo ſacto, and not restored, vntill he repents, and publiquely revokes ſuch his wicked errors.</hi> Then by vertue of this Canon, he that writes againſt Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſhould be taught better manners. He ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to Satan by his Dioceſan, for to tame his fleſhly, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21372:7"/> diuiſion-making faction in the Church, to teach him, and his priuate friends Canonicall obedience. And tis very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to doe for tranſgreſſing the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon, which is the 4. law. The words are theſe. <hi>When in time of Diuine ſeruice, the Lord Ieſus ſhalbe mentioned, due, and lowly Reverence ſhalbe done by all perſons preſent, as it hath beene accuſtomed: Teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies and Geſtures their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humility, Christian Reſolution, and due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt the True, and Eternall ſonne of God, is the only Sauiour of the world, in whom alone all the mercies, Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Maior is not true: for bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a Ceremony and a duty: How can that be? Thus: As bowing of the knee, ſignifies the religious bowing of the heart at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſo it is a religious Relation, or Ceremony: and eſſentially it hath reference only to the ſignified humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Heart, that this doth honour <hi>Ieſus</hi> by bowing at his name. But relatiue obedience muſt haue its <hi>Terminum ad quem, or Finem Cui:</hi> a Perſon, to whom tis tied: ſo this bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> hath the perſon of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> for to him we muſt bow. In ſignification then of its Correlate, which is the bowing of the Heart, it is a Ceremony; In vſe, or practiſe tis a duty, due to the perſon of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> At the time of Gods rewarding <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the Text not long after ſayth: <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee ſhall bow &amp;c.</hi> thus tis a duty commanded by God himſelfe. At the neglect of bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus, the</hi> 18. <hi>Canon of our Church ſayth, that all preſent at diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſhall bow at the name of Ieſus.</hi> Thus tis a duty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Church. <hi>We muſt bow to teſtify our humility of Heart,</hi> thus tis a moral Ceremony. For <hi>Ieſus</hi> his ſake wee muſt bow. So Bowing as the thing conſidered is both duty and Ceremony: but for a diuerſe conſideration, as tis a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, you ſee tis not a duty, and as tis a duty, it is not a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. The ſame thing bowing hath a twofold reſpect: the one of morall ſignification, to make it a Ceremony: the other of practice commanded, to make it a duty. Mentall deuotion will not ſerue. <hi>God will haue both corporall, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to expreſſe it by: ſo</hi> BP. <hi>Andrewes.</hi> We muſt bow with our knees <hi>and confeſſe thus implicitely, that Ieſus is the Lord.</hi> Thus the ſame BP.

                  <p>At 148. <hi>pſalme.</hi> all things are commanded to praiſe the Lord: <hi>viz:</hi> Angells, ſunne, and moone, the heauens, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnder the heauens, the Dragons, and all deepes: fire, and hayle &amp;c. Muſt all theſe creatures then, praiſe the Lord in one, and the ſame manner: or rather according to that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which God hath giuen to euery creature? The Angells praiſe God in their kinde, ſinging their <hi>Halleluiahs: Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp.</hi> 19. The ſunne, and the moone praiſe God in an other manner, in running their Courſes &amp;c. <hi>pſal.</hi> 19. Euery thing in his owne way doth praiſe the Lord. It is thus in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> The Angells, and Saints in heauen doe bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as it becometh them, who liue in the ſtate of glory: and the Militant Church doth bow, as they ought which liue in the ſtate of grace, ſo farre forth as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme their will to God.

The <hi>Terminus a Quo,</hi> whence <hi>Ieſus</hi> began to humble himſelfe, is his Equality with God in forme, or Eſſence; in his owne thought equall to God <hi>ver.</hi> 6. The firſt deſcent of his humiliation is his putting of the Glory of his diety; He made himſelfe of no Reputation, anſwearable to his Maieſty. Then hee tooke on him the forme of a ſervante: this is his conception by the holy Ghoſt. Then he was made like vnto men, this is his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Then he was found in ſhape as a man: this is his Nativity. Then he humbled himſelfe liuing in obedience to poore Parents. Then he became obedient vnto the death. No ſooner was he borne: but King <hi>Herod</hi> ſought after his life. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. No ſooner did he preach, but his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen, and kinſmen were offended at him. For caſting out Deuills, he is proclaim'd to be a Coniurer: For his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21372:21"/> and Maieſty obſcurely perceaued, he is accuſed for a Seducer, and a Traitor. Then he ſubmits to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Iudge, and he condemn'd him, and his owne Nation did crucify him. Now behould how <hi>Ieſus</hi> perform'd a Sauing ſuretiſhip for vs to God the Iuſt Iudge. We are the tranſgreſſors of Gods law: and therefore <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to die. We are the Traitors againſt the king of Heauen, and <hi>Ieſus</hi> was put to death. This is <hi>Ieſus</hi> his greateſt ſauing humility: obſerue it well, whether it be meritorious, and ſo meritorious, as to be honoured by all rationall Creatures. The Holy Ghoſt doth teſtify, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> his humility hath deſeru'd all honour of Heauen, and Earth, and Hell. Such a deſert ſo well deſeruing muſt needes inferre a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And what is that? God hath highly exalted him, and giuen him a name aboue every name: that at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> euery knee ſhall bow of things in Heauen, of things in the earth, and of things vnder the Earth. And that all tongues ſhall confeſſe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord. I will repeate Arch-BP <hi>Whitguifts</hi> words: Theſe. One reaſon, that mooved Chriſtians in the beginning rather to bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> than at any other name of God was, becauſe this name was hated, and moſt contemned of the wicked <hi>Iewes,</hi> and other Perſequutors of ſuch as profeſſed the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> For other names of God, they had in reverence: but this name they could not abide. Wherefore the Chriſtians to ſignify their faith in <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and theit obedience to him, and to confute by open geſture the wicked opinion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and other Infidels, vſed to doe bodily reverence at all times, when they heard the name of <hi>Ieſus, but especially when the Goſpell was read, which containeth the glad tidings of ſalvation, which is procur'd vnto man by</hi> Ieſus Chriſt &amp;c. <hi>Neither can it be againſt Chriſtianity, to ſhew bodily reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence &amp;c. Theſe are the words of Orthodox D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Whitguift, the moſt Reuerend</hi> Arch-BP <hi>of Canterbury, in his Anſweare to</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas Cartwright in the defence of the Anſweare to the Admonition,</hi> pag. 742. 'Tis merit, why <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the

There the text ſayth more of the Sonne, than of the Father: not becauſe the Sonne hath more Authority than the Father: but becauſe the ſonne ſhould not ſeeme to be inferiour to the Father: At <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. Merit is cauſe, why <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the greateſt name of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd to vs to worſhip. And the reaſon is very infallible. For ſeeing that God only in the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> would humble himſelfe, and ſuffer ſhame, and rebuke: therefore in the ſame name, he is, and wilbe to the worlds end, moſt of all magnified. He wilbe more magnified in his name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> than in any other Title. For no other name of his, but <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſhame, reproofe, death and Hell. Swearing diſhonours God: Idolatry more: but God hanged on a tree: this is the great curſe, the moſt ſhamfull diſhonouring of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Yet <hi>thus Ieſus redeemed vs from the curſe of the law Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>He was crucified in the fleſh</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>Ieſus was ſlaine, and hang'd on the Tree. Actes</hi> 5. 30. Still 'tis merit, why <hi>Ieſus</hi> is exalted, why his name is aboue every name. God hath then rewarded <hi>Ieſus;</hi> and he requires our duty, to bow at his name, and ſo acknowledg, that his name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is aboue euery name, that he hath. God hath rewarded <hi>Ieſus</hi> freely. <gap reason="foreign">

He being dead in body, God raiſ'd him from death: He did not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption. When the humanity could not helpe it ſelfe, then God did, and raiſ'd <hi>Ieſus</hi> to honour. There is the gift aboue every gift. <hi>Ieſus</hi> his hands were enabled to

                  <p>A laſt note that bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a duty of the text, and that we muſt bow in time of divine ſervice, is <hi>Philip:</hi> 2. 10. 11. For then we muſt bow, when our tongues ought to confeſſe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord. <hi>Every knee ſhall bow,</hi> and every tongue ſhall confeſſe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord. Theſe muſt goe vnſeparably togeather: ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Prinne.</hi> And when muſt wee confeſſe that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord? Not till the laſt day? No Chriſtian dares ſay: That 'tis true. For we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord in time of divine ſervice. At the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21372:22"/> generall confeſſion of our ſinnes, we doe actually confeſſe that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord, and then we bow. At rehearſing the Apoſtles Creede, we ſtand, and bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> our Lord, <hi>who was conceiued by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> &amp;c. At the ſecond Leſſon, though we ſitt, yet we bow. At the Goſpell we bow ſtanding. The glorified bodies muſt bow at the laſt day. The regenerate bodies muſt bow in the time of Grace. For Grace doth owe her knees to <hi>Ieſus.</hi> And her knees are not in her heart but thereby gouern'd. Hence it is, that good Chriſtians doe bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> teſtifying thereby that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord, that died the death of the Croſſe to ſaue ſinners. And therefore with retribution of hearty thankes, for that ſupervaluable benefit, we praiſe <hi>Ieſus</hi> the exalted, with heart, and knee at once. And the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> giue vs grace ever to bow, &amp; ſuch ſafety therein, that we neuer be hindred by <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt.</hi> Now obſerue, whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Prinne</hi> doth come nigh the meaning of <hi>Philip:</hi> 2. 9. 10. 11. verſes, as they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to the 5. 6. 7. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that 'tis not the meaning of the text, that our <hi>knees ſhall bow at the name of Ieſus in time of divine ſervice,</hi> ſeeing he doth not vſe theſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. 1. Becauſe <hi>Ieſus</hi> did not deſerue this honour of bowing. 2. That God did not giue <hi>Ieſus</hi> this honour, being dead. 3. That God hath not commanded vs to bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> although <hi>Ieſus</hi> hath deſerued more then knee-honour. 4. That <hi>Ieſus</hi> did not deſerue ſo vniverſally for every member of our bodies, that the knee muſt giue him honour. 5. That <hi>Ieſus</hi> was not the only vilified name of the Lord. 6. That there ought to be no bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the time of Grace, but only in the time of Glory. (This he would make his friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, but therin he hath deceiu'd them). 7. That the time of of bowing is vtterly ſeparated from the time of the tongues confeſſing, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord, if the time be the time of the practiſe of grace in the Temple.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21372:31"/> his private friends belieue, that he will teach the reall mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the text, or elſe he hath forgotten himſelfe, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Queſtion concerning the meaning of <hi>Philip,</hi> 2. diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the literall meaning, which is a part of the letter, if the letter hath any ſignification. And I belieue, that he is on the literall meaning here at this part of his Appendix. For there are <hi>tres ſpecies</hi> three kindes of the dictionall, or literall meaning: this is true metaphyſically, according to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of eſſence, though the vulgar diviſion <hi>Entis rationis in ſcripturis,</hi> of the written word of God be literall, and figuratiue. Theſe are the three ſpecies: 1. is grammaticall: 2. is rhetoricall, whereof metaphoricall is a part, 3. is logicall. Only metaphoricall bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> He ſayth, is vnderſtood at <hi>Philip:</hi> 2, 10. This diſpute beginnes at a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> which hath no reference to a <hi>Firſt place,</hi> expreſſed in the Appendix. This is to diſpute <hi>ſine capite</hi> without an head. But is bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> metaphoricall, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and ſo dictionall? Certainely 'tis reall: for 'tis eſſentiall, a reall ſubordination of the knee to a religious heart in the ſtate of grace: and in the time of glory euery knee, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and corporeall ſhall really bow. Beſides this reall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> depends on reall cauſes. The 1. is Gods command, which requires the Church to bow, for all knees are commanded, which are the knees of things in heaven, of things in the earth &amp;c: then bowing &amp;c. is lawfull. The 2. is <hi>Ieſus</hi> his merit, which is the Holy Ghoſts reaſon, and 'tis a neceſſary reaſon, becauſe 'tis iuſt, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> bee rewarded with all honour, and therefore with knee-honour. The 3. is the loue, and honour, and glory of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which we owe to him; this is the end of bowing, which makes it commendable. Maſter <hi>Prinne</hi> then muſt be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in his owne way, that eſſentiall, and demonſtratiue argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may overtake him, and binde him to his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, becauſe he ſayth, that this bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is metaphoricall. But our knees are not metaphoricall, but ſubſtances, corporeall, organicall, and obedient. He ſayth,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21372:32"/> that bowing &amp;c. is one, and the ſame in all creatures: and yet all haue not knees alike. He ſayth, that bowing &amp;c. is ſubiection of all creatures to <hi>Ieſus</hi> at the laſt day, only at the laſt day. But our Church doth now teſtify, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Lord now in the time of grace with bowing of the knee: and is this a ſinne againſt any law of God? <hi>Obſtante Prinne,</hi> this is a duty of the text.</p>

               <p>This kind of bowing in <hi>Philip</hi> 2. 10. is metaphoricall.

                  <p>This Argument is 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> argument of the letter of the text: &amp; twiſe a fourthly in this Queſtion. But here note that this bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> now Queſtioned is externall diuine worſhip in our Church; 'tis adoration: and now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Prinne</hi> may know what kinde of bowing, bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is. There is adoration inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at <hi>Eſay</hi> 45, 23. &amp; at <hi>Rom:</hi> 14. 11. <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of bowing at the laſt day: for there the text teacheth Gods people to forſake Idols, and bow, or giue worſhip to him. But when? not till the laſt day? <hi>Rom:</hi> 14. 10. teacheth, that we muſt all ſtand before Gods Iudgment ſeat, that he only is Iudge, and therefore we muſt not Iudge one an other: at the 11. <hi>verſ,</hi> that we worſhip him, becauſe he is the Lord.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21372:32"/> And <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. teacheth the merit of <hi>Ieſus</hi> rewarded. How? that every kneeſhall bow at the name of Ieſus. Therefore the Church hauing learned her duty, that now Ieſus is to bee acknowledged to be the King farre aboue all dominion, Principality, and Power, ſhe bowes the knee with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and reverence, to manifeſt her bounden duty, and to teſtify, that it is Gods command, that he be more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> than in any other name of his. This is the reaſon of vayling, and bowing the knee at the exalted name <hi>Ieſus.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to be deduc'd from <hi>Philip:</hi> 2, and more, than at <hi>Eſay,</hi> 45. and <hi>Rom:</hi> 14, and therefore wee muſt bow more, than is requir'd by theſe texts. But how that can be, ſee the vncouering of the Head, and bowing of the knee, not only at praier, but at reading, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our faith, which is in the Lord <hi>Ieſus. Philip:</hi> 2. teacheth that we muſt be humble in the practice of grace, and how we muſt be humble: <hi>That we muſt bow at the name of Ieſus.</hi> That text teacheth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that all knees muſt bow. And then ought not that Church, and euery Church collect this doctrine; <hi>That the knees of the Church vniuerſall must bow at the name of Ieſus? Saint Paule did not teach the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians: that they ſhould not bow till the laſt day: but his words are, that they ſhould be preſently humble verſe the</hi> 5. Neither did hee teach them, that their knees were Angels knees, which doe now bow in Heauen. <hi>Revel.</hi> 4: but that all things muſt bow their owne knees; and therefore the militant Church muſt bow her knees, at the name of the Lord <hi>Ieſus.</hi> The Diuils doe bow, for they haue their bounds, which they cannot paſſe. It were anſwere ſufficient, to deny, that all creatures bow in the ſame particular, or proper way. And that they muſt only bow at the laſt day, the 15 ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which M. <hi>Prinne</hi> hath alleadged, doe not proue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12. doe not teach that all, creatures muſt only bow at the laſt day. Nor <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 20, 21, 22. nor <hi>Revel.</hi> 1, 7. nor <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. from ver. 8, to the end of the chapter. nor <hi>Revel.</hi> 20, 11. 12. 13. nor <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. nor 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi>

Not one of theſe, nor any other Scripture ſaith, that the Church and all other creatures muſt bow at the name of the Lord Ieſus only at the laſt day.

So in the ſecond place according to the two kinds of bowing, bowing with the knee at the name of Ieſus, is proued to be religious according to more of <hi>Prinnes</hi> good Authors: But how they are good for him, he cannot be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nor intellectuall: for neither ſence nor reaſon calls no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all (and ſo nothing to the purpoſe) a proofe; nor a falſe quotation, a true and good Authority.</p>
                  <p>3 Some of M. <hi>Prinnes</hi> authors giue the reaſon, why all knees muſt bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus; propter meritum, &amp; praemium,</hi> becauſe Ieſus hath deſerued, and God hath rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his merit. <hi>Quid &amp; quantum humilit as mereatur, oſtendit.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21372:34"/> how much honour Ieſus his humility deſerues, &amp; therefore is it too great an honour, that at the name of Ieſus euery knee ſhall bow?

Me thinkes that the regenerate (if lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) doe know, that holy worſhip hath ſo neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Grace, that the contrariety, and contradiction of mans will muſt not make a profeſſed change of, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting from pious worſhip, and religious perſeuerance. Ieſus hath and doth alway performe his part of covenant: He is alwaies mercifull. And the regenerate muſt performe his part of Gods couenant. He muſt depend on the cauſe, on the author of habituall, and actuall grace, in applying, &amp; imploying himſelfe in all religious obedience too, and for the Lord Ieſus. For <hi>quifecit te ſine te, non vult ſervare te ſine te:</hi> he that made thee without thee, will not ſaue thee, if thou be diſobedient.

                     <p>CEremonies of State, I commend to Heralds at Armes, and their adherents. Morall ceremonies, an vncouered head, a curteous ſpeech, a bended body, and knee, let the Moraliſt take, to ſignify his curteous heart, wiſhing all happineſſe to the perſon ſaluted, &amp;c. Nor may I here ſpeake of every outward ſigne: for the ſignes, which did ſignify Chriſt to come, were the <hi>Iewes</hi> Typicall ceremonies, and they are aboliſhed. And the ſignes, which doe ſignify Ieſus dead for ſinnes, are the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: nor are theſe ſignes of Chriſts death, within the letters of this queſtion.

Theſe ſignes which are expreſſe Scripture, are vniverſall, and ſo neceſſary cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Catholique Church, as the firſt foure, and ſo are all ceremonies, which are pregnantly deduceable out of holy Writ. Tis more then probable that the Church, being rationall, able to giue a reaſon of her morall ſignificant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, tooke theſe Scriptures, &amp;c. to bee the rule and ground of her ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the vniverſall, there are particular, decent, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonies, which are not one and the ſame in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: ſo our 34 Article. Neither their matter, nor forme is commanded in the text. Againſt the text they muſt not be: &amp; they muſt be convenient, decent, and orderly for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and times, and mens manners, where they are eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: thus they are harmeleſſe ceremonies. Theſe particular ceremonies are no duties of the text: but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> requires that they be decent and orderly. Theſe are the indifferent ceremonies, indifferent for matter, as an hairecloath or ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, or ſome other vile cloath might be the ceremony of penance, as well as the white ſheete. Indifferent for colour, for as white analogically ſignifies pureneſſe of faith ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitiuely gray ſignifies ſeniority, blacke, mortification: Scarlet, the vndauntedneſſe of mind, &amp;c. Here then is varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and every country may chooſe his colour. But I call no particular ceremonies ſo indifferent, as that a man may or may not vſe them <hi>pro ſuo Arbitrio,</hi> as he will himſelfe. Hee muſt vſe them being therevnto commanded. Every ſoule muſt be ſubiect to the Higher Powers in theſe things, which are not contrary, nor in part contradictory to Gods word; be they ceremonies, be they what they are: they muſt be obſerved for conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. And although ſome ceremonies are indifferent, in reſpect of coveniency or aptneſſe of ſignification: yet you muſt vnderſtand, that they are neceſſary when they are commanded: and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt make them neceſſary againe, which indulgence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21372:40"/> makes to be but indifferent, or rather preſumption groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on indulgence. The ſumme of all is this. The eſſence of Church ceremony <hi>in genere</hi> in kind, is a morall ſigne; in correlation tis a morall Chriſtian duty ſignified: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality is decency, and order: the Author of ceremonies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the new Teſtament is the Holy Ghoſt: the author of ceremonies deducted from Scripture by pregnant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is the Church, and theſe are, or ought to be the Ceremonies of the Church vniverſall.</p>
                     <p>Ceremonies deducted from analogy of Scripture for the conveniency of Countries, times, and mens manners, are particular ceremonies. The vſe of all ceremonies according to their nature, author, and end is harmeleſſe: for tis a good, morall, decent, and orderly expreſſion, of a ſignified duty, by a morall, decent, and orderly ſigne. The property of no ceremony commanded is indifferency: for command, and indifferency cannot, nor may they dwell together. Muſt I repeat vnto you in this place how bowing at the name of Ieſus is a duty of the text, and how tis a ceremony: Thus then: as tis an humble obedience to this commanding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. ſo tis a duty of the text. As tis a morall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and orderly ſigne of bowing of the heart at the name of Ieſus, manifeſted by the knee: tis a ceremony, a neceſſary ceremony, it ſhould neuer ceaſe to be in any Church; 'tis an vniuerſall ceremony: for God requires it in all Churches: not only for a day or a yeare, but for ever: ſo perpetuall are Gods morall commands. They that doe not practiſe this bowing doe diminiſh ſomewhat from the ſcripture: and if they will not amend, let them expect a iudgement: The Scripture doth direct them, where they may behold their condemnation. Theſe arguments following haue no helpe in them, to deliuer a man from danger, which the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient may incurre.</p>

                        <hi>Ieſus</hi> who is called <hi>Iustus.</hi> Then let him learne theſe notes. <hi>Ieſus</hi> who is <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is only at <hi>Act:</hi> 7. 45. and at <hi>Heb:</hi> 4. 8. And <hi>Ieſus</hi> which is <hi>Iuſtus</hi> is read only at <hi>Coloſſ:</hi> 4. 11. The 2 former ſcriptures are not ſo plaine, as the laſt, to know the <hi>Ieſus</hi> there ſignified. But remember, that I haue put you, and your Brethren in minde, where you muſt forbeare to bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Doe Papiſts committ Idolatry with their <hi>Images, Altars, Croſſes,</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes?</hi> This is Indirect Idolatry: ſo much I haue obſeru'd out of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect worſhip of <hi>Images.</hi> Direct Idolatry is a ſinne againſt this law: <hi>Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but me.</hi> To bow downe before <hi>Images, Crucifixes,</hi> &amp;c: is a ſinne againſt the ſecond commandement.

But the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the Hoaſt is Idolatry: 'tis a giuing of the honour of the Creator vnto the Creature. And Tranſubſtantiation is a groſſe ſinne. By a Popiſh conceipt, it is a Confuſion of <hi>Ieſus</hi> his glory, more Tyrannicall, than the pulling of <hi>Ieſus</hi> his skinne, ouer his eares. For Tranſubſtantiation <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo a Quo,</hi> is a ſeperation of <hi>Ieſus</hi> his All-glorious Eſſence from his moſt glorious Inſeperable Accidents: And <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no ad quem</hi> 'tis a confining <hi>Ieſus</hi> vnder the ſuperficies of an inches length, and bredth: or thereabouts in their ſacrament, with more than a 1000 parricular contradictions. This is much like Maſter <hi>Prinns</hi> ſeparating the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> from the ſignified <hi>Ieſus:</hi> as if the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> had no ſignification, no ſenſe, becauſe a Perverſe Humoriſt thinks ſo ignorantly of vnlearned Proteſtants, as if they did bow to the fiue letters.</p>

                     <p>The maior is a divine axiome, ſo worthy for truth, that all Chriſtians muſt belieue it. The minor is the Text. Thus: All knees are commanded to bow at the name of Ieſus, and the Churches knees are included in all knees.</p>

                     <p>All Religious Church-honour is to be giuen to <hi>Ieſus</hi> in time of divine ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is religious Church-honour. Therefore bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is to be giuen to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in time of diuine ſeruice. It is adoration ſo the Fathers, and Maſter <hi>Prinne</hi> at his compares.</p>

                     <p>5 Argument</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From the intent of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paules exhortation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To be humble is neceſſary at time of divine ſeruice. To bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is to be humble. Therefore to bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is neceſſary at time of diuine ſeruice. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth humility at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>6 Argument</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is a demonſtration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 There is the cauſe: <hi>Ieſus by dying deſeru'd bowing of the knee at his name.</hi> 2 There is the effect: which is <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee.</hi> 3 There is the ſubiect, which is <hi>the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus:</p>
                     <p>Where <hi>Ieſus</hi> deſeru'd by his death, bowing of the knee at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> there muſt be bowing of the knee at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Church, <hi>Ieſus</hi> deſerued by his death that there ſhould be bowing of the knee at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore in the Church there muſt be bowing the knee at the name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> But is not the death of <hi>Ieſus</hi> worthy of knee-honour? Heard-hearted Blaſphemy!</p>
                     <p>7 Argument</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From Gods gift.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatſoeuer God hath giuen to <hi>Ieſus</hi> we acknowledge to be due vnto him. To bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> in time of diuine ſeruice God hath giuen <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Therefore to bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> in time of diuine ſeruice wee muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be due to him. The <hi>Minor</hi> is true. For God hath giuen <hi>Ieſus</hi> all Power: and therefore the Church muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Ieſus</hi> with internall, and externall honour.</p>
                     <p>8 Argument</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From the proportion of</hi> Ieſus <hi>his merit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ieſus</hi> deſerued grace for the whole man: therefore grace in euery part of man muſt ſerue <hi>Ieſus:</hi> therefore the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates mans knee muſt bow to <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the time of grace.</p>
                     <p>9 Argument</p>
                     <p>This propoſition is true of corporall, and ſpirituall knees,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21372:48"/> 
                        <hi>At the name of</hi> Ieſus <hi>every knee ſhall bow:</hi> therefore <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name at which the Churches knees muſt bow.</p>
                     <p>And now you may know evidently: that <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name at which euery knee muſt bow: whether they be knees of the regenerate or of the glorified. And let Maſter <hi>Prinne</hi> be aſhamed of his fighting againſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and his Church. This is his folly: he hath diſhonoured <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and ſo the king, the Vice-Gerent of the Lord <hi>Ieſus.</hi> And is he not affrayde?</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Turning of Communion-Tables into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, That is contrary to the Scripture <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>Luc:</hi> 22. 21. But why ſhould not we bow towards the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table: though it be neither ſcripture nor canon, to bind vs thus to bow: yet an orderly decent ceremony may and ought to be admitted into the Church: ſo our Church teacheth. There is ſufficient reaſon; why we ſhould bow towards or at the Holy Comunion-table. For we muſt bow at his Maieſties Chaire of State, this is a knowne truth: and the King is <hi>Ieſus</hi> his Deputie in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Chaire of State of the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> his cheifeſt place of preſence in our Church is the Holy Communion-table, and therfore we may bow thereat without Idolatry, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy thereby the honour that belongs to the Almighty King. Seeing <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the ſaving king, our king of glory, we ſhould bow there, which is the ſigne of rhe place, where he was moſt deſpiſed, diſhonoured, and crucified. So we ſhall be good ſouldiers of the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> &amp; ſtout warriers againſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours mortall Adverſaries, even in our very geſture. And now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prinne</hi> aſſuredly know, that Reverent, and orthodoxly learned Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Boyes</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hooker Zanchius</hi> were no Romanizing Proteſtants: and that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Adams,</hi> and <hi>Giles Widdowes</hi> doe truly, and reſolutely hould all our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tenents of faith in the 39 Articles, of Gods Holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the common praier-booke, and Eccleſiaſticall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Canons 141. which no <hi>Puritan</hi> will endure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a kind of ſtiffe Ieſuit in his opinion, and practiſe. His, and the Papiſts ends are all one: though their waies to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21372:48"/> their ends doe differ ſo much, as the ſcripture bafled, and the Church corrupted.</p>
                     <p>And now let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Prinne,</hi> and his private freinds forbeare to diſpute againſt the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon, for tis the rule of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to cauſe the renewing of Bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> where 'tis neglected. Let them not denie, that <hi>Philip:</hi> 2. is the fundamentall precept, to teach Chriſtians to bow humbly, &amp; reverently, when <hi>Ieſus</hi> is named at divine ſervice: for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paule thereby did teach the <hi>Philippians</hi> a duty due to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which he calls bowing with the knee. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Prinnes</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors call that bowinw adoration, an inward, and outward adoration, deſerued by the lowly humility of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and giuen by the Father. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Prinne</hi> doth belieue the ſcripture. 'Tis well if in the proper ſence, The Canon he belieues. Well, if he did, and his owne Authors: for ſhame theſe he cannot deny. Then let him, &amp; his freinds bow at the name of <hi>Ieſus propter meritu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; praemium,</hi> becauſe the obedience of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is rewarded with this degree of glory: which is a name aboue every name, and therefore it is to bee honored with the knees of Grace, and Glory.</p>
                     <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Prinne</hi> vnderſtand, for you owe knee-obedience to the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> or els He is not the commanding, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Maſter of the knee. You compell me to call you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your expoſition of <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 10. the Allegoricall Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of theſe daies: your knees are turn'd metaphors, and you <hi>ſimilitudo hominis</hi> the ſhadow, or likenes of a man, and ſo your bowing at the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is Metaphoricall. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull divinity! Heartles knee! Ill diſpoſed ignorance! Becauſe you are ſo wilfull in defence of your error, I dare you to diſpute face to face in the Schooles &amp;c. that you may no longer trouble the Church: for the writing violence of a Schiſmatique is impudent, and endles. It is certaine that you are more will than intellect, therefore your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> to his Vice-Gerent the King, and to the Church may become you well. If you dare not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and will not conforme, then write no more for ſhame.</p>
